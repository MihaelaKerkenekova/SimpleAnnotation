<h1>Simple Annotation </h1>


A small php project that insert semantic on classes using annotations.<br />
Today, many programming languages are using annotations for to manager injection depending and
inversion of control. In the php's core, we haven't this feature, but some projects like <a href="#">Symphony</a> 
<a href="#">Doctrine</a> and <a href="#">DocBlox</a> was implement.
This project (with a filosophy <a href="#">MicroPHP manifesto</a> "where small and simple is better") have a goal of
be a simple layer for insert annotations in other php small projects.<br /><br /> 

<h2>TODO</h2>
- Add new semantic rules, for example: @var date('Y-m-d H:i:s') for create um Validator better.
- Use a APC or other cache manager 
- Use the Reader from Doctrine
